This project implements a Battery Life Predictor using Deep Learning techniques. The goal of the project is to estimate the remaining lifespan of a battery based on input parameters such as charge/discharge cycles, capacity, resistance, and other electrical characteristics. The model leverages a neural network architecture to learn complex patterns in battery behavior over time, enabling accurate predictions of battery degradation. Data preprocessing steps include feature scaling and encoding categorical variables where necessary, ensuring that the inputs are optimized for neural network training. The model is trained on historical battery performance data, and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy. This predictor can be applied in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage systems, and consumer electronics to anticipate battery replacement needs and optimize usage. The repository includes the full implementation in Python, along with examples for testing and visualizing predictions.
